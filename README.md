# viewport-preview

A tool for previewing a web page in a number of different viewport widths, using iframes.

Hosted here: https://viewport-preview.simonwillison.net/

Add the URL to the page to preview as the `?url=` parameter, for example:

- https://viewport-preview.simonwillison.net/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.com%2F

The supported widths and devices are taken from the table on this page: [Adobe Experience League: Mobile viewports for responsive experiences](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/experiences/vec/mobile-viewports.html).
